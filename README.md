# ðŸ˜» Cat-List: a place to find your purr-fect cat! (...sorry)

## Deployed Site

I have deployed the site on firebase -> [here](https://cat-list-77efe.web.app/my_list)

### list of dependancies
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

### Where to find api endpoints?

In the 'hooks' directory.

I have created some hooks and used React Query to handle the api calls.
You can also find the api key in the 'react-query' folder. I realise I should create a proxy server to hide the api-key.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Next Steps?

It was a fun, short project. If I continue I will add..
- [ ] upload
- [ ] votes
- [ ] more media queries
- [ ] add better error handling
